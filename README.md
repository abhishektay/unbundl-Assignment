taskk 1


Explanation-

HTML: The structure is basic, with a container for the carousel, image items, and navigation buttons.
CSS: The styling is kept simple for a clean and responsive design. Flexbox is used for the carousel layout.
JavaScript: Handles the logic for showing the next and previous slides, and sets up an interval for automatic rotation.


task 2

Explanation-
HTML: I kept the webpage structure simple. There's a title, a section for chocolate options, and a display for the total price. Each chocolate choice is a clickable box.
CSS: I made the chocolate boxes look clean. When you hover over them, they subtly change color. If you select a chocolate, it gets a distinctive background color. The layout adjusts to different screen sizes.
JavaScript: The code manages what happens when you click a chocolate. It toggles the selection (like a light switch) and updates the total price. It's like counting the prices of the chocolates you've chosen.
Reasoning: I wanted a straightforward solution without making things complicated. This makes it easy to understand and quick to use. We used basic tools (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) without extra frameworks to keep things simple and accessible for everyone.
